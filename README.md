#### üö≤ My projects

Here's a list of some of my major projects indirectly related to my blogging activities.

* [subgen_bot](https://t.me/subgen_bot) - a special bot in Telegram for converting voice tracks to text and subtitles, capable of extracting voice from YouTube videos and understands any audio, video, and voice messages;
* [3DNews (RSS)](https://t.me/news3d_unofficial) - a small [PHP project](https://github.com/EvilFreelancer/rss-to-telegram-bot) that crawls the 3DNews site's RSS feed and posts messages in my Telegram channel, created because the official 3DNews Telegram channel rarely publishes news;
* [–•–∞–±—Ä / ML & AI](https://t.me/habr_ai) - Telegram channel where you can find publications from RSS feeds of thematic hubs ‚ÄúMachine Learning‚Äù and ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence‚Äù of the Habr portal;
* [LinuxGizmos.com](https://t.me/linuxgizmos) - Telegram channel that automatically gets filled with content using the same PHP crawler as 3DNews;
* [ZaborMUS](https://t.me/zabormus) - a Telegram channel where I talk about various strange and unusual music;
* [deletebg_bot](https://t.me/deletebg_bot) - a simple Telegram bot for removing backgrounds from images;

PS. This list will be updated.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Games for Programmers

Initially, I launched this project on Steam because I wanted to receive good recommendations for games, but most curators were talking about the same AAA titles, so I wanted to create my own curator with games I like.

* [Steam curator](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31790204/) / [Steam group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/games-for-programmers) / [Telegram channel](https://t.me/gms4prgs)
